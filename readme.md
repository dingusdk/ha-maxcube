# READ FIRST

I have made a pull request with this code, so when it has been merged into HA you should remove this custom component again.

Here you can read about my current problem with the maxcube in HA:

https://community.home-assistant.io/t/maxcube-loosing-configuration/46663)

The maxcube-py file is a copy of the maxcube component in home-assistant.
I have added the option to configure the update interval.

To use it place it in a custom_components folder in your HA configuration folder - this will override the build-in maxcube component.

You can add an "update_interval" to the configuration like this:

```yaml
maxcube:
  host: 192.168.1.4
  update_interval: 300
```

The update_interval is in seconds - so 300 is 5 minutes.

This is a temporary solution to test if it will actually fix the issue in HA.
It can take several week for the reset to happen, so I want to make sure before I make a more permanent solution.
